# TDD Test List Phase

You are now in the **Test List Phase** of TDD. Follow these instructions to create a comprehensive test list.

## Your Mission

Create a test list using `it.todo()` that covers **every rule and every example** from the specification:
1. Read the specification (`prompt.md`) thoroughly — every rule, every example, every clarifying question (❓)
2. Turn each example into at least one `it.todo()` test case
3. Order tests from simplest to most complex
4. Use `it.todo()` only — NO executable tests yet

## Context: $ARGUMENTS

## Process

### Step 1: Understand the Feature
Read the complete specification. Pay special attention to integration examples and clarifying
questions (marked with ❓) — these disambiguate rules that may seem open to interpretation in isolation.
- What are all the operations the system must support?
- What rules govern each operation?
- Which examples in the spec illustrate these rules?

### Step 2: Identify Test Cases from the Spec
Walk through the specification section by section. For each rule and each example:
- Create a test case that verifies the described behavior
- Include the **expected values from the spec** in the test description
- If a clarifying question (❓) resolves an ambiguity, create a test for the clarified interpretation
- If the spec uses an example-mapping format (rules, examples, questions), every listed example must have a corresponding test

### Step 3: Order Tests (Simple → Complex)
Arrange tests in increasing complexity:
1. Simplest case (often empty/zero/single item)
2. Individual rules in isolation
3. Rules with modifiers
4. Combinations of multiple rules
5. Multi-step scenarios (e.g., operations that reference earlier results)

### Step 4: Write Test File
Create the test file with `it.todo()` entries:

```typescript
import { describe, it, expect } from "vitest";
import { functionName } from "./implementation.js";

describe("Feature Name", () => {
  it.todo("should [behavior] — [expected value from spec]");
  it.todo("should [next behavior] — [expected value from spec]");
  // ... ordered simple → complex, covering ALL spec examples
});
```

### Step 5: Provide Summary

After creating the test list, output:

```
📋 Test List Created:
**Feature**: [feature name]
**Test File**: [filename].spec.ts
**Tests**: [count]

**Test Cases** (ordered simple → complex):
1. ✅ [first test description]
2. ✅ [second test description]
3. ✅ [third test description]
...

**Next Step**: Invoke `/red` to activate the first test.
```

## Important Guidelines

### DO
- ✅ Cover **every spec example** with at least one test
- ✅ Cover **every operation** described in the spec
- ✅ Give **every clarifying question (❓)** a corresponding test
- ✅ Order tests **simple → complex**
- ✅ Use `it.todo()` for all tests
- ✅ Include **expected values** in descriptions
- ✅ Keep tests **independent**
- ✅ One behavior per test

### DON'T
- ❌ Write executable tests (use `it.todo()`)
- ❌ Think about implementation instead of behavior
- ❌ Miss an entire operation described in the spec
- ❌ Order randomly

## Completion

After completing the test list, proceed to Red phase:
