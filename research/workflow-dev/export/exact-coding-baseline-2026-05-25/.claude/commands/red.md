# TDD Red Phase

You are now in the **Red Phase** of TDD. Follow these instructions to activate ONE test and make it fail.

## Your Mission

1. Activate exactly ONE test from the test list
2. Make explicit predictions about how it will fail
3. Verify the test fails for the right reason
4. Maintain strict discipline - NO implementation during Red phase

## Context: $ARGUMENTS

## Red Phase Rules

- **One test at a time**: Convert exactly ONE `it.todo()` to executable test
- **All other tests remain as `it.todo()`**: Never have more than one failing test
- **Two-stage failure**: First compilation error, then runtime/assertion error
- **Make predictions**: Explicitly state expected failures before running tests
- **No implementation**: Don't write code to make test pass yet

## Process

### Step 1: Activate One Test

Identify the next `it.todo()` and convert it to executable test code:

```typescript
// Convert from:
it.todo("should return 0 for empty input");

// To:
it("should return 0 for empty input", () => {
  expect(calculate("")).toBe(0);
});
```

Leave all other tests as `it.todo()`.

### Step 2: Predict Compilation Error

Before running the test, state your prediction:

```
🔴 Red Phase - Compilation Error Prediction:
- Test: "should return 0 for empty input"
- Expected: Compilation error
- Reason: Function `calculate` doesn't exist yet
- Error: "Cannot find name 'calculate'"
```

### Step 3: Run Test - Verify Compilation Error

Run `pnpm test` and verify:
- ✅ Compilation error as predicted, OR
- ❌ Prediction wrong → follow the Prediction Failure Protocol below

### Step 4: Create Empty Function

Create minimal function stub (no logic):

```typescript
export const calculate = (input: string): number => {
  return undefined as unknown as number; // Intentionally wrong
};
```

### Step 5: Predict Runtime Error

Before running again, state your prediction:

```
🔴 Red Phase - Runtime Error Prediction:
- Test: "should return 0 for empty input"
- Expected: Runtime assertion error
- Expected value: 0
- Actual value: undefined
- Diff:
  Expected: 0
  Received: undefined
```

### Step 6: Run Test - Verify Runtime Error

Run `pnpm test` and verify:
- ✅ Assertion error as predicted, OR
- ❌ Prediction wrong → follow the Prediction Failure Protocol below

### Step 7: Report Completion

You MUST output the full Step 7 block verbatim with `Correct` or `Incorrect`
chosen for each prediction. Do not abbreviate. Do not collapse the two
prediction lines into one.

**Why this format matters:** The block is mechanically parsed by tooling to
verify the Guessing Game discipline. The parser expects two lines matching
`(- |✅ |❌ )(Correct|Incorrect)` per cycle — one for the compilation
prediction, one for the runtime prediction. Collapsing them into a single
line, summarizing them as "both correct", or skipping the block entirely
loses the signal. Format consistency here matters even outside batch runs:
it makes the prediction quality visible to you and any future reader.

```
🔴 Red Phase Complete:
**Test Activated**: "should return 0 for empty input"
**Compilation Prediction**: Cannot find name 'calculate' ✅ Correct
**Runtime Prediction**: Expected 0, received undefined ✅ Correct
**Result**: Test fails as expected with assertion error
```

### Step 8: Apply HITL Checkpoint

Consult `@.claude/rules/human-in-the-loop.md`. If the current Autonomy Level
includes a stop after Red phase, present the checkpoint template from that
file and wait for explicit user approval before proceeding to Green. If the
level does not stop after Red, proceed directly to Green phase.

## Important Guidelines

### DO
- ✅ Activate exactly ONE test at a time
- ✅ Make explicit predictions before running tests
- ✅ Verify test fails for the right reason
- ✅ Keep all other tests as `it.todo()`

### DON'T
- ❌ Activate multiple tests
- ❌ Skip making predictions
- ❌ Write implementation to make test pass

## Prediction Failure Protocol

If your prediction was wrong:

```
❌ Prediction Failed:
- Predicted: [what you expected]
- Actual: [what happened]
- Discrepancy: [explanation]
```

Then apply the **Prediction Failure Recovery** procedure in
`@.claude/rules/human-in-the-loop.md`. In every Autonomy Level except
`autonomous`, this is a hard stop — the human decides whether you continue
or investigate first.

## Completion

After Step 8 (HITL checkpoint), proceed to Green phase if approved or if
the Autonomy Level does not require a stop:

```
🔴 Red Phase Complete. Proceeding to Green phase.
```
