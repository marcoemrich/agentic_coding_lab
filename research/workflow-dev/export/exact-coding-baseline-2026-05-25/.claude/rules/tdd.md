# TDD Rules — Hybrid (v6, exact-coding baseline)

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Skill + Subagent Usage is MANDATORY

This workflow is a **hybrid** of two architectures:

- **`/test-list`, `/red`, `/green`** run as **Skills in the main context** —
  they share state, so the model keeps test list, last error, and current
  implementation in working memory.
- **Refactor** runs as a **Task subagent with isolated context** — the
  refactor agent sees only the current source/tests, not the full red/green
  history. Hypothesis: refactoring benefits most from a fresh perspective
  free of implementation bias.

Do NOT perform TDD phases without invoking the appropriate skill or agent.
If you write test code, implementation code, or refactorings directly in the
main context instead of delegating, the workflow loses the architectural
separation that makes the hybrid work.

### Before Starting Any TDD Work — Complete This Checklist:

- [ ] Have I been asked to implement something using TDD?
- [ ] Am I about to write tests or implementation code?
- [ ] **STOP** — Use the Skill tool (test-list/red/green) or the Task tool (refactor)
- [ ] NEVER write tests, code, or refactorings directly — ALWAYS delegate

### Which Tool to Use:

| Phase | Mechanism | Invoke With |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| Test List | **Skill** (main context) | `Skill({ skill: "test-list" })` |
| Red Phase | **Skill** (main context) | `Skill({ skill: "red" })` |
| Green Phase | **Skill** (main context) | `Skill({ skill: "green" })` |
| Refactor Phase | **Task subagent** (isolated context) | `Task({ subagent_type: "refactor", prompt: ... })` |

**If you find yourself writing test code, implementation code, or a
refactoring without invoking the right tool first, you are doing it WRONG.**

## Overview

This project follows strict Test-Driven Development practices using the
Red-Green-Refactor cycle. The workflow keeps red and green in a shared
context so predictions, error messages, and minimal implementations stay
coherent — and isolates refactoring so the model evaluates the resulting code
on its own merits.

This baseline supports **configurable human-in-the-loop checkpoints** between
phases. See `@.claude/rules/human-in-the-loop.md` for the Autonomy Level
setting and stop behavior.

## TDD Workflow

### 1. Test List Phase
**🚨 INVOKE SKILL**: `Skill({ skill: "test-list" })`

Provide: feature, test file path, implementation file path, requirements.

The skill creates a comprehensive test list using `it.todo()` covering every
rule and example from the specification.

**DO NOT** write the test list yourself.

### 2. Red Phase
**🚨 INVOKE SKILL**: `Skill({ skill: "red" })`

Provide: test file path, which `it.todo()` to activate, current passing-test
count, implementation file path.

The skill activates exactly ONE test, makes explicit predictions, and
verifies failure.

**DO NOT** write test code yourself.

### 3. Green Phase
**🚨 INVOKE SKILL**: `Skill({ skill: "green" })`

Provide: test file path, failing test name, current error, implementation
file path.

The skill implements minimal code to make the test pass — hardcoded returns
are fine for early tests.

**DO NOT** write implementation code yourself.

### 4. Refactor Phase
**🚨 LAUNCH AGENT**: `Task({ subagent_type: "refactor", prompt: ... })`

**Required prompt context** (the subagent has no memory of red/green — give
it everything it needs):

```
Task({
  subagent_type: "refactor",
  prompt: `
    Test file: src/<feature>.spec.ts
    Implementation file: src/<feature>.ts
    Passing tests: <count>
    Recent Green phase: <one-line summary of what was just added>

    Refactor the implementation while keeping all tests green.
  `
})
```

The agent will improve code while keeping tests green:
- MUST attempt at least one refactoring (or document why none is possible)
- Evaluate naming FIRST
- Apply Four Rules of Simple Design (priority order)
- Calculate APP (Absolute Priority Premise) mass before/after

**DO NOT** refactor code yourself — let the agent do it. After it returns,
read its summary, apply any test-runs needed for sanity, then consult
HITL (next section) before proceeding to the next Red phase.

### 5. Repeat
Return to step 2 (Red phase) for the next test. **Invoke the `red` skill
again.**

## Human-in-the-Loop

Between phases, the workflow consults `@.claude/rules/human-in-the-loop.md`
to decide whether to pause for human approval. The default Autonomy Level is
`full-hitl`, which stops after Test-List, Red, and Refactor (not Green) and
on prediction failures. Switch levels by editing the setting at the top of
the HITL file — see that file for the full table.

For unattended batch runs, set the level to `autonomous` to disable all
stops.

## Core TDD Principles

### TDD Mindset
TDD practices will feel counterintuitive:
- **Hardcoded returns feel "too simple"** — This is correct!
- **The urge to implement ahead is strong** — Resist this
- **Minimal steps feel inefficient** — They actually accelerate development
- **Predictions feel unnecessary** — They build crucial understanding

### Common TDD Failure Modes
- **🚨 NOT USING SKILLS / SUBAGENT** — The most critical failure mode
- Multiple active tests at once
- Implementing beyond what tests demand
- Skipping predictions
- Avoiding refactoring
- Refactoring in the main context instead of via the subagent

## Technical Setup

See `@.claude/rules/tdd-with-ts-and-vitest.md` for TypeScript and Vitest
configuration. See `@.claude/rules/tdd-execution-mode.md` for the execution
model (skill/subagent sequence + optional done-marker).

## Running Tests

Run tests with `pnpm test`.

## Remember

- **🚨 ALWAYS USE SKILLS** for test-list/red/green; **ALWAYS USE THE SUBAGENT** for refactor
- Never write tests, implementation, or refactorings directly
- Refactor subagent runs in an isolated context — give it everything it needs in the prompt
- Trust the process — discomfort is a signal you're doing it right
- Consult `@.claude/rules/human-in-the-loop.md` at every phase boundary
