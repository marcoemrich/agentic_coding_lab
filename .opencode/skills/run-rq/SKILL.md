  Use this skill to drive a research question (RQ) end-to-end: validate the
  RQ README, generate a fill batch-plan, start the Docker batch in the
  background, monitor progress, run aggregation, and propose findings updates.
  Trigger when the user says "RQ-N voranbringen", "run-rq", "fill RQ-N",
  "run RQ-N", "Forschungsfrage N starten", or names a specific RQ-N directory
  in research/.

# Skill: run-rq

End-to-end orchestration for advancing a single research question (RQ) in this lab repo. **Pure orchestration** — every operation calls existing repo scripts; no new Python or Bash code is written.

## Argument

- `RQ-N` (e.g. `RQ-model-quality`) or a direct path to an RQ dir.
- If not given: infer from the last user turn, otherwise ask back ("Which RQ? e.g. RQ-model-quality").

## Repo conventions (from the top-level `README.md` and memory)

- RQ dirs live in four subtrees: `research/questions-claude/<chapter>-*/` (Claude-Code RQs), `research/questions-opencode/<chapter>-*/` (OpenCode RQs), `research/questions-cross/<chapter>-*/` (harness-übergreifende RQs), and `research/workflow-dev/<chapter>-*/` (workflow evolution). The `<chapter>` prefix (e.g. `2.6`) is an **ordering label, not an id** — the stable identity is the frontmatter `id:` (e.g. `RQ-lean`). Each RQ dir holds `README.md`, `findings.md`, `runs.csv`, `summary.md`.
- **Resolving an `RQ-<slug>` id to a path** (the dir name carries a chapter number, not the id): grep all subtrees for the frontmatter `id:`. Anchor with `^id:` and a trailing boundary so the whole slug must match exactly (no slug is a prefix of another, so an exact-line match is unambiguous):
  ```bash
  RQ_DIR=$(grep -rlE "^id:[[:space:]]*RQ-model-quality[[:space:]]*$" \
             research/questions-claude/*/README.md \
             research/questions-opencode/*/README.md \
             research/questions-cross/*/README.md \
             research/workflow-dev/*/README.md \
           2>/dev/null | head -1 | xargs -r dirname)
  ```
  On no match → ask the user. On multiple → take the first and inform the user. Pass `"$RQ_DIR"` to all scripts below (they accept any path and write outputs to the dir).
- Mandatory frontmatter fields: `id, question, factors, controls, outcomes, min_replicates, status`.
- Methodology constraint: v1/v2 only with `prompt: prose`; v3/v4/v5 with all three styles. If `factors.workflow_x_prompt` exists, no additional `factors.workflow` / `controls.workflow` is allowed.
- Active katas: `game-of-life`, `mars-rover`, `claim-office`. `controls.kata_base` must be from this set.
- Model IDs are **lab-variant IDs** (`opus-4-7`, `opus-4-7-no-thinking`, `opus-4-6-portkey`, `opus-4-6-portkey-no-thinking`, `sonnet-4-6`, `sonnet-4-6-no-thinking`, `sonnet-4-6-portkey`, `sonnet-4-6-portkey-no-thinking`, `haiku-4-5`, `haiku-4-5-no-thinking`, `haiku-4-5-portkey`, `haiku-4-5-portkey-no-thinking`). The `-portkey` suffix marks models routed via the Portkey gateway.
- Aggregation is query-based: ALL runs in `experiments/runs/` matching the selector query count — regardless of which batch produced them.
- Batch plan is idempotent: counts existing matches and only fills missing replicates up to `min_replicates`.

## Phases

Run sequentially. On errors in any phase, **stop and ask the user**, do not skip ahead.

---

### Phase 1 — Validate

1. Resolve the RQ path into `$RQ_DIR` via the id-grep in "Repo conventions" above. On no match, ask the user; on multiple, take the first and inform the user.
2. Read `$RQ_DIR/README.md`.
3. Parse the frontmatter block (between the first two `---` lines). Check mandatory fields: `id, question, factors, controls, outcomes, min_replicates, status`. Missing fields → abort phase, inform user.
4. Check methodology constraints:
   - If `factors.workflow_x_prompt` is set: no additional `factors.workflow` and no `controls.workflow` may be set.
   - In every `workflow_x_prompt` entry: if `workflow ∈ {v1-oneshot, v2-iterative}`, then `prompt == prose` is required.
   - `controls.kata_base ∈ {game-of-life, mars-rover}`.
   - Model values (in `controls.model` and/or `factors.model`) must appear in the lab-variant table.
5. Read `findings.md` (needed in phase 6 as the existing baseline).
6. Target computation: from `factors` × `controls` derive the cell count (every factor multiplies; paired factors like `workflow_x_prompt` count as a single factor with `len(pairing)` values). Target runs = cells × `min_replicates`. Report this number to the user.
7. **Portkey routing detection**: scan model values (in `controls.model` plus every `factors.model` entry) for a `-portkey` suffix. If any match:
   - Check `~/.claude.portkey/` directory exists. If missing: STOP, instruct the user to follow `experiments/docker/claude-config-portkey.README.md`. Do **not** start the batch.
   - Note: `batch.sh` auto-detects Portkey models from the plan JSON and sets `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` automatically. No manual env-var needed in phase 3.

Output to user (compact):
```
RQ-N validated: <id>, <#cells> cells × min_replicates=<n> = <target> target runs.
status: <status>
[Portkey routing required — using ~/.claude.portkey/ profile]   ← only if portkey_required
```

---

### Phase 2 — Plan

1. Run dry-run:
   ```
   experiments/batch-plan-from-rq.py "$RQ_DIR" --dry-run
   ```
2. Output contains the count of missing runs. Inform user:
   ```
   Cells: X, missing runs: Y → would write experiments/batch-plans/rq-{n}-fill.json
   ```
3. If `Y == 0`: no new runs needed — jump straight to phase 5.
4. Otherwise: get user confirmation ("Write the plan with Y runs now?"). Only proceed after explicit "yes".
5. Write the plan without `--dry-run`:
   ```
   experiments/batch-plan-from-rq.py "$RQ_DIR"
   ```
6. Briefly inspect the generated plan (Read on `experiments/batch-plans/rq-{n}-fill.json`) and summarize the cell distribution (`{kata, workflow, model}` frequencies) to the user.

---

### Phase 3 — Run

1. **Pre-check**:
   - `docker ps --filter name=docker-batch-run --format '{{.Names}}'` — if a container is running: STOP and ask the user whether the existing batch should finish first.
   - If `experiments/docker/batch.log` from an earlier run exists and is >0 bytes: ask the user whether to back it up as `experiments/docker/batch.<plan>.log` (`mv`, no deletion).
2. **User confirmation** before start: "Start batch `rq-{n}-fill` with Y runs in the background? Expected wallclock ≈ Y × 6 min ≈ Z min." (6 min/run per memory, smart-subset experience.) For Portkey RQs (flag from phase 1.7), append: "via Portkey gateway (auto-detected)".
3. Start with `--detach` (backgrounds the batch and disowns the process so the terminal can be closed safely):
   ```bash
   cd experiments/docker && ./batch.sh rq-{n}-fill --detach
   ```
   Portkey routing is **auto-detected** by `batch.sh`: it scans the plan JSON for `-portkey` model names and sets `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=~/.claude.portkey` automatically. No manual env-var override needed. For sharded runs (>30 runs), add `--shards N` (max 6):
   ```bash
   cd experiments/docker && ./batch.sh rq-{n}-fill --shards 4 --detach
   ```
4. After a few seconds, determine the container name via `docker ps --filter name=docker-batch-run --format '{{.Names}}'` and report it to the user.

---

### Phase 4 — Monitor

1. Polling loop with `experiments/docker/watch-batch.sh rq-{n}-fill`:
   - First 5 min: snapshot every 60 s.
   - After that: every 5 min.
   - On every poll, report the counter `[N/total]` and container status.
2. Termination conditions:
   - `Container STOPPED` AND counter = `[total/total]` → success, continue to phase 5.
   - `Container STOPPED` AND counter < total → resume (phase 4b).
   - User signals abort → `docker stop <container>` → resume (phase 4b).
3. **Important**: Take memory patterns seriously:
   - `\b429\b` with `claude_exit != 0` = real rate limit; backup-warning with `backup.<ms>.json` (which can incidentally contain `429`) is to be IGNORED.
   - "Claude configuration file not found at: …" at container start is harmless.
   - Do not panic-retry when `watch-batch.sh` is once slow to respond.
4. **Mid-execution cleanup after stop**: the youngest run dir in `experiments/runs/` that lacks `analysis-report.md` OR `transcript.jsonl` was interrupted mid-execution. Ask the user: "Delete interrupted run dir `<run-dir>` (no analysis-report.md)?" Only delete with `rm -rf` after explicit "yes".

#### Phase 4b — Resume

1. Generate a resume plan:
   ```
   experiments/docker/resume-plan.sh rq-{n}-fill
   ```
   → writes `/tmp/rq-{n}-fill-resume.json`.
2. Show the size to the user (`jq '.runs | length' /tmp/rq-{n}-fill-resume.json`).
3. Get user confirmation: "Restart with `<m>` remaining runs?"
4. After "yes" — resume with `--detach` (Portkey auto-detected from plan content):
   ```bash
   cd experiments/docker && ./batch.sh /tmp/rq-{n}-fill-resume.json --detach
   ```
   Back to phase 4.

---

### Phase 5 — Aggregate

1. **Pipeline sanity check before aggregating** — pipeline bugs masquerade as research findings. Spot-check 2–3 of the matched runs (covering the workflow × model cells most central to the RQ) for divergence between `run.log` and `metrics.json`:
   - In `run.log` the agent typically reports a final test status (e.g. "All N tests pass", "experiment-done.txt written"). Compare this against `final_metrics.tests_passing` in `metrics.json`. If the agent reports green but `tests_passing` is `false`, that's a pipeline issue, not a workflow effect.
   - Grep `analysis-report.md` for known infrastructure failure patterns: `IGNORED_BUILDS`, `approve-builds`, `corepack`, `ENOENT`, `Cannot find module`, `tsc.*error`. These typically come from container/tooling drift (e.g. pnpm version bumps, missing deps), not from agent code.
   - For CLI-katas (`<basename>-verification/` exists): check `cli_built` in `metrics.json`. If `cli_built: false` for a run whose `src/cli.ts` exists and runs manually (`pnpm exec tsx src/cli.ts < scenario.input.json`), the verification stage misfired — re-run `analyze-run.sh <run_dir>` on the host (with absolute path).
   - If any of these checks fail: stop, report the suspected pipeline bug to the user, do NOT aggregate. Fixing buggy data after a finding has been drawn from it is much more expensive than spending two minutes on the spot-check.
2. Invoke:
   ```
   experiments/aggregate-by-query.py "$RQ_DIR"
   ```
3. Expected outputs:
   - `$RQ_DIR/runs.csv` (one line per matched run)
   - `$RQ_DIR/summary.md` (per-cell pivots for each `outcome`)
4. Read `summary.md` in full and summarize to the user — show the per-cell pivot tables individually.
5. Sanity check: does every cell have ≥ `min_replicates`? If not: warn and offer to jump back to phase 2 (additional runs).
6. **Plausibility cross-check before phase 6** — if any cell value contradicts a previously-stable finding by a large margin (e.g. a workflow that was 100% green is suddenly 0%), do NOT treat that as a new finding without first running the spot-check from step 1 against that exact cell. A "v4 is suddenly broken on game-of-life" type observation is more often a pipeline regression than a real shift.

---

### Phase 6 — Findings (write-first)

**Write directly to `findings.md`, then notify the user to review.** Markdown tables and trophy assignments are much easier to evaluate as rendered output than as a chat proposal; reverting is cheap (it's only markdown). After writing, send one line: "geschrieben — lies drüber".

Exception: **deletions** of existing findings still require explicit user confirmation before the `edit` — losing a documented finding is more expensive than re-reading a fresh write.

`findings.md` shows **only the current state**. No status tags (`✅ stabil` / `⚠️ bedingt` / `🚫 offen` / `❌ widerlegt`), no comparisons with archive snapshots or older studies, no "previously X, corrected" hints in the prose. Header form: `## F-x.y — title` (no `· …` suffix).

**Overview table**: `findings.md` starts with a `## Übersicht` section containing a pivot table of the primary outcome across all factor levels (all models, all prompt styles, etc.) — before the individual `F-x.y` blocks. This table gives readers the full picture at a glance; individual findings then zoom in on specific effects. Update this table whenever findings are added or updated.

**Trophy convention (🏆) in overview tables**: append 🏆 to the best value per outcome row. Conventions:

- The direction is metric-dependent — note it in the column header or row label (`smell_total` etc. → "kleiner = besser"; `refactorings_applied`, `predictions_correct_rate` → "höher = besser"). Don't assume.
- Use 🏆 only where there is a meaningful winner. If the spread is below 1 σ and the framing is "no effect", award 🏆 to all near-tied values (or to none if the table message is "indistinguishable") — don't fabricate a winner from rounding noise.
- Multiple 🏆 are fine for ties. Three 🏆 across a row signal "no effect", which is itself a useful reading aid.
- Always bold the winner value too — 🏆 is in addition to, not instead of, the bold.
- Trophies belong only in human-facing research documents (`findings.md`, archive snapshots). Workflow files (`experiments/workflows/**/*.md`) stay emoji-free per the RQ-emoji / CLAUDE.md convention.
- **Correctness-gating** for code-quality and efficiency metrics: when the RQ has a correctness outcome (typically `verification_pct`), trophies for quality/efficiency metrics (`smell_*`, `cognitive_*`, `mccabe_*`, `cc_*`, `duration_seconds`, `total_tokens`, `cost_usd`, also derived $/perfect-result ratios) go **only** to models with `verification_pct = 1.0`. A model that scores low on complexity / cost / duration but failed the verification is showing a stub or abort artifact, not parsimony or speed — awarding a 🏆 there is misleading. State the rule explicitly in the table's caveat block when it applies. Pure correctness metrics (`verification_pct` mean / std) are not gated. RQs without a correctness outcome (pure code-quality studies on game-of-life) are also not gated.

1. Diff sources:
   - **Existing**: `findings.md` from phase 1.
   - **New**: `summary.md` from phase 5.
2. Three possible actions per effect:
   - **New finding**: cell/factor group with Δ ≥ 1σ over the other groups AND the effect is not yet covered in `findings.md` → new `F-{N}.{M+1}` block (M = highest existing finding number). Write directly.
   - **Update**: an existing finding covers the same effect, but cell values or interpretation have shifted → `edit` the existing block directly. Rewrite table and rationale, **without** old/new diff, **without** "previously X", **without** reference to archive snapshots.
   - **Deletion**: data contradicts the finding → ask the user first ("Finding F-x.y wird durch neue Daten widerlegt — entfernen?"), then remove the block including its `---` separator on confirmation. Do not mark as "widerlegt".
3. Data gap: if an effect is suspected but coverage is too small for `n ≥ min_replicates` → note in `todos_and_ideas.txt` (section "Re-Check ungeprüfter Hypothesen aus alten findings.md") as a bullet with a concrete re-check target. **Do not** create as a finding in `findings.md`.
4. Format per block: statement / data-base table / rationale. Header `## F-x.y — title` with no suffix.
   **Glossary discipline**: terms like `code_mass`, `cc_loc`, `cc_longest_function`, `smell_total`, `verification_pct` are to be used only in the form from the glossary in the top-level `README.md` ("Code-Mass (APP)", "Produktiv-LoC", "Spitzen-Komplexität", "Smell-Summe", "Korrektheit (außen)") or directly via the metric ID in backticks. Synonyms like "Code-Volumen", "Code-Gesamtvolumen", "LoC-Größe" are forbidden — they are ambiguous or collide with established definitions (APP). Before writing, read the glossary once and check every term used in the block against the table.
5. After writing all new/updated blocks, send one short line to the user: "geschrieben — lies drüber". The user reviews the rendered markdown directly.

## Out of scope (deliberately NOT in the skill)

- The actual batch execution inside the container (`run-batch.sh` runs in the container).
- ESLint / smell detection (runs per run inside `analyze-run.sh`).
- Cross-RQ aggregation or creation of new RQs.
- Auto-commit/push of `runs.csv` / `summary.md` / `findings.md` — stays a user decision.
- Worktree switching or merging into `main`.

## Behavior on errors

- **Phase 1 fails**: do not continue; give a clear constraint hint (e.g. "v1-oneshot with prompt=example-mapping violates the methodology constraint in the top-level README, section 'Methodology constraints'").
- **Phase 2/3 scripts with non-zero exit**: show output to the user; do NOT blindly retry.
- **Phase 4 loses the container**: show `docker ps -a`, then offer resume.
- **Phase 5 produces an empty `runs.csv`**: check whether `experiments/runs/` actually contains matching runs (selector too narrow?). Inform the user.
